Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Tulsi! When I'm not managing a team of Support Engineers, you can find me stepping in as a Project Manager. I shine in that funky space between developers and end users- It's my mission to provide excellent customer service while acting as a technical liason.

I hold my Master's degree in MIS (Management Information Systems), where I dabbled with code. I am looking to advance my coding skills while remaining client focused.

You can find some of my work from my Master's program here:
<br>[Application: A game where successful clicks correspond to an increase in your score](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java-OOP)
<br>[Application: The calculation and conversion of time](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java-OOP-2-)
<br>[Java Applet: Drawing a sea turtle](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java-OOP-3-)
<br>[Application Game: Computer versus human guessing game that involves numbers](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java-OOP-4-)
<br>[Application: Drawing a traffic light controlled by button](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java--OOP-5-)
<br>[Application: Calculating and translating data into a pie chart](https://github.com/KuberDown1/Java-OOP-6-)
