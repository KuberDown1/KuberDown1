Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Tulsi! When I'm not managing a team of Support Engineers, you can find me stepping in as a Project Manager. I shine in that funky space between developers and end users- It's my mission to provide excellent customer service while acting as a technical liason.

I hold my master's degree in MIS (Management Information Systems), where I dabbled with code. I am looking to advance my coding skills while remaining client focused.
